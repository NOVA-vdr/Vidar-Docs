```
fn main():
	println("Hello, World!")
fine
```
Hm... no big difference with other languages

```
fn main():
	a int8 = 1
	b str = "Hello"
	c int = 1~10
	println(c[5])
	println(b[0])
	println(int(a) + 10)
fine
```
Hmm.. I can't get it

```
fn main():
	print(sum(1, 2))
fine

fn sum(A int, B int) (int):
	return A + B
fine
```
Just as I expected

```
fn main():
	a int = 1
	if a:
		is 3:
			print(3)
		is 2:
			print(2)
		is 1:
			print(1)
	else:
		print("else")
	fine
	
	
	if a == 1:
		print("true")
	else:
		return null
	fine
fine
```

What is it??
